# AIEthicsChecklistGenerator

# Concept:
Create a simple web-based application that guides a user through a series of questions about their AI project (e.g., "What kind of data are you using?" "Who is the intended user?"). Based on the answers, it generates a personalized checklist of potential ethical, privacy, and legal issues they should consider.
